# Machine Learning Models from Scratch
## About
Python with numpy implementation of some of the machine learning models and algorithms from scratch.

The purpose of this project is not to produce as optimized and computationally efficient algorithms as possible but rather to present the inner workings of them in a transparent and accessible way.
